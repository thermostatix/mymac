#This is a small repo for starting out with a Mac.

It is intended only to help you work on an AWESOME terminal, complete with colour-coded commandline prompt, and a few basic commands that may or may not make things go quicker.
##Installation & Use
Clone the repo
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:thermostatix/mymac.git
Simply copy the file to your home directory and rename it using that dot...
- cp mymac/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
Restart your terminal
- source ~/.bash_profile

Voila!

Bottom line:
